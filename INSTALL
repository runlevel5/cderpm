1) Install the RPM for your platform.

On Fedora 34 and higher the xinitd package is no longer included.
You can however build and install an rpm from the fc33 sources.

The .src.rpm file can be downloaded here:
https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1577957

Install the .src.rpm file, and in your rpmbuild directory's `SPECS` dir (e.g.
`~/rpmbuild/SPECS`) run `rpmbuild -ba xinetd.spec`. After successful build you
will be able to install the rpm from your rpmbuild directory's RPMS dir.

2) Make sure rpcbind is running:
       systemctl enable rpcbind.service
       systemctl start rpcbind.service

   NOTE: rpcbind should be running with "-i" as an argument.  This is set
   in /etc/sysconfig/rpcbind by the RPM %post scriptlet.

3) Make sure xinetd is running:
       systemctl enable xinetd.service
       systemctl start xinetd.service

4) You probably want to disable the firewall or figure out which ports to
   poke holes for.
