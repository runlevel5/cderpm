cderpm
======

This is my own fork of zssfred/cderpm

I do not intend to support distro that has reached EOL.

RPM spec file, patches, and scripts to package up the Common Desktop
Environment.

The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) from The Open Group is now available
under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later (LGPLv2+).
The project can be found here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/

This project is an RPM spec file and related files used to build an
installable CDE package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Linux
systems.


TARGET PLATFORMS
----------------

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (x86_64, ppc64le)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (x86_64, ppc64le)
Fedora 35 (x86_64, ppc64le)
Fedora 36 (x86_64, ppc64le)

I may not have all platforms building at a given time, which is why I refer to
them as targets rather than requirements.  I'm always interested in patches to
get things building and packaging on other Red Hat-derived distributions.


AVAILABILITY
------------

TBU - at this stage, I have not built nor published any RPM that could be consumed yet
